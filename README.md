Multi-AI Agent System (MAS) 🧠🚀

🔹 Overview

The Multi-AI Agent System (MAS) is a modular, scalable, and AI-powered automation platform designed to automate business processes across multiple industries.

Using our multi-agent AI architecture, businesses can create infinite AI agent automation flows by adding customized AI agents to fit their needs. MAS provides a robust foundation, and we have pre-built example flows to demonstrate its capabilities.

MAS is built to be multi-tenant, event-driven, and highly customizable, making it ideal for automating repetitive workflows, processing business communications, and making intelligent decisions in real-time.

🔗 Available AI Agent Automation Flows

Each AI agent automation flow is housed in a separate repository, allowing businesses to utilize and extend only the workflows they need. You can create your own automation flows by adding new AI agents!
